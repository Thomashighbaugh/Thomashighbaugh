# Change Log

This exists to log my work on the project as a means of remembering what I had last done, and why, to mitigate issues that have arisen elsewhere without cluttering my vimwiki with these sorts of temporary and passing notes.

I do not need to use SemVer, as I use the rolling release model for personal projects for now. When that changes I will probably use that system of numbering for my releases. This is an especially useless first example, as I need to make my commits just to test changes, which made me re-examine what is the actual joint in my development process, which is when my attention turns away and the project sits for various lengths. That is the more appropriate joint in most projects, when attention goes dormant than how often I remember to commit and push my work (already my means of saving the work for the day as doing that is far more secure than local storage).

### Added

- This change log, a test of a process I may incorporate everywhere depending on the trial experiene.
- Directory for the icons
  - Added svg icons for each of the contact links to replace banners that were hard to get to align properly
- Created Table under Contact to regularize the spacing of the icons
- Contact header added with `colspan` to prevent issues with spacing out the table below
- New banner image (will possibly/probably change)
- Moved drop downs to the left of the image
  - Due to the height of the new image being more reasonable and banner-like, this makes for a more tolerable dropdown experience while being less obtuse and awkward as it was before.
