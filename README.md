  <p>Yes, I made the SVG file above, taking inspiration from something similar I tried to recreate the look of the cable menu from the late 90s with colors from my custom vice color scheme [v i c e](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/base16-vice-scheme). I know, I am that over-the-top that I made my own color scheme instead of settling with someo other, less than ideal, colorscheme that's all the rage on r/unixporn. </p>
 <p> As suggested by the image, I also make <i>digital art</i> (primarily because a lifelong health condition makes my hands shake really intensely at times, but I can still type or use a mouse just fine, this is <b><i>(really, incredibly not) awesome</i></b> to explain to hiring managers. Legal or not, when you are broke and don't like spending every day the court is open in it there is no way to do anything about it). This means that almost all of the graphics I use for my repos are personal creations, with icons being the natural exception as I am not reinventing fontawesome's work everytime I work on a web project and need a basic icon.  </p>
